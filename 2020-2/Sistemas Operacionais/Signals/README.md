## üîµ Introduction
The purpose of this group activity is to study the source code of the Linux system, proposed during the course of 1001535 - Operational Systems, offered by the Department of Computing at UFSCar in the 2020/2 semester.

## üîµ Goals 

- [x] Study the structure maintained by the kernel for the control of signals received by processes
- [x] Study the mechanism for deactivating the reception of signals and the installation of a routine for handling specific signals
- [x] Study the sending of signals and the treatment for non-ignorable/manageable signals by the processes
- [x] Study the reception of signals, and the execution of a programmed action (scheduler)
- [x] Check the effect of signals on TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
- [x] Check the effect of sending the SIGCHILD signal to blocked processes with wait( ) and waitpid( )

## üîµ Using the project
